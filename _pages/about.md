Greetings! I'm Xuyang. I earned a dual Ph.D. in Civil Engineering and Computer Science at Michigan State University (MSU). My work focuses on interdisciplinary research in engineering mechanics and scientific machine learning (SciML), particularly in structural health monitoring (SHM), system identification, and finite element modeling. I had the privilege of being advised by Prof. [Nizar Lajnef](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~lajnefni/) and Prof. [Vishnu Boddeti](https://hal.cse.msu.edu/team/vishnu-boddeti/).

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at Penn State University (PSU), focusing on applied scientific reinforcement learning, supervised by Prof. [Romit Maulik](https://romit-maulik.github.io/Members.html).
